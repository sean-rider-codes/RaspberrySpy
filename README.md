## Wireless Remote Security Camera System Using Raspberry Pi

### Part 1: Overview
### Project Motivation:
This project was created to provide users with a user-friendly, low-cost, and highly customizable security camera system.
The idea came when a friend of mine's apartment was robbed. There were security cameras in the apartment, however they only backed up
to the SD card on the camera device itself. This proved to be a problem when the burglar stole the security camera as well. My friend
was left with no footage of the crime and the burglar was never found.
I was amazed that there were companies selling product with such an obvious design flaw, and when thinking about it, several other
flaws in the system became apparent. What happens if the camera is damaged, destroying the SD card? What happens if the camera loses its
connection with its power source? How about if the SD card gets full? I set out to create a security camera system which addresses these
issues at a more affordable cost than a full on Closed Circuit system.

### Solutions:
The two problems I most want to address are the vulnerabilities of a wireless system which only stored data locally, and the extremely
high price of modern closed circuit systems.
